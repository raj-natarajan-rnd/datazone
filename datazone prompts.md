Need to create documentation - file name Readme.MD
1. Summarize the full setup - in a very easy to understanding way. Include an architecture diagram
2. Review all folders for all code and summarize what resources been deployed for each account. Some are in CloudFormation and some in Python.
3. Deployment steps in proper order and make sure what account should be deployed into.
4. Test scripts and what is being tested - summary table

Make sure to run thru multiple iterations and make sure documentation is accurate
